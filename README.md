## Schibsted coding excercise

### Build guide
- First you need to clone the project from GIT repository
- Build the project using Gradle: gradlew clean build
- After that you can find target artifact (jar archive) under build/libs directory
- You can run it using command like: java -jar build/libs/indexer-1.0.0.jar directoryWithTextFiles

### My choices
- I choose Kotlin because I still learning that, so I wanted to did some practice
- In indexing solution I choose multiple maps because of internal implementation, with a lot of keys this solution may keep performance

### What I wanted to do but I didn't do because of time (I didn't want to work a lot more than suggested 4 hours)
- More tests
- A few improvements in structures and architecture
- In my production solution I probably would like to choice something production ready as Lucene for example :)
